Milestone 3 - Task 4: Semantic Search

Implements natural-language search across historical meetings, matching
the spec's flow exactly:

    User Query
        |
    Query Embedding
        |
    Vector Search
        |
    Relevant Meetings
        |
    Search Results

The project requires relevant meetings to be retrieved within 3 seconds -
`semantic_search` measures and returns `elapsed_seconds` on every call so
this can be verified/monitored (see test_semantic_search.py and the
LATENCY_TARGET_SECONDS constant below).

# Below this cosine-similarity score, a match is treated as "not actually
# relevant" rather than forced into the results - this is what lets Task 5
# correctly say "I don't have information about that" instead of always
# returning whatever the closest (but irrelevant) chunk happens to be.
# NOTE: this threshold is calibrated for the "local" fallback embedder's
# bag-of-words hashing scores. A real embedding provider (e.g. OpenAI)
# produces a much wider, more semantically meaningful score spread, so this
# same threshold works there too - but if you swap in a different provider
# and see too many/too few "not found" results, this is the constant to
# retune.

    Retrieves the top matching chunks from the vector store, then
    aggregates to one result per meeting (keeping each meeting's
    best-scoring chunk) so a meeting with several matching chunks doesn't
    crowd out other relevant meetings in the results. Supports metadata
    filtering by content_type and/or meeting_id. RAG passes
