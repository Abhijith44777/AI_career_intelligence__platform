Milestone 3 - Task 5: RAG Question Answering

Implements the RAG workflow using the existing API and database, matching
the spec's flow exactly:

    User Question
        |
    Semantic Search
        |
    Relevant Meeting Context
        |
    LLM
        |
    Grounded Answer

The LLM is instructed to answer ONLY from the retrieved context and to say
so explicitly when the answer isn't in it - this is what "answers are based
on retrieved meeting information and not unsupported or hardcoded
responses" (the task's verification requirement) means in practice. Every
answer carries its `sources` (which meetings/chunks it was grounded in) so
the claim is checkable, not just asserted.

If no LLM API key is configured, this degrades to a purely extractive
answer built directly from the retrieved chunks (same zero-hallucination-
by-construction fallback philosophy as llm_service.py's "local" provider) -
grounding is guaranteed either way.
